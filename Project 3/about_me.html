		Hello, my name is Joshua Tharrington. I currently live in Warrenton Nc, a small country town that borders Virginia.
		I am currently attending Wake Tech and part of their cybersecurity program, so far it has been really great, I feel like I have learned a lot.
		I actually started college back in 2015 but was not really sure what I wanted to do with my life, so I stopped going. After working many years
		in customer service jobs I decided that I had enough and wanted to start working towards a career. I knew I wanted to do something with computers but was not sure exactly what I
		should pursue so I looked up what Wake Tech had and I saw that the cybersecurity program had a lot to offer. Knowing hardly anything about cybersecurity I decided I could learn some useful things and applied.
		So far this program has taught me a lot of new material. I am excited to get more into penetration testing, I have been trying to learn some in the little spare time I have.

		<br>
		<br />
		Right now I am working for a delivery service partner for Amazon, I do it part-time on weekends which usually takes up the entire day. It is an excellent job especially if you are going to.
		school. I only work three days a week and get four days off, plus the pay is fairly good. All I do is listen to music all day and deliver packages, it is a really chill job.
		I am a full-time student so most of my spare time is spent doing schoolwork. Usually in my spare time I will put on a movie and relax or play a video game. I also like to spend time with my dog Cookie, 
		a fiesty little Chihuahua mutt that I have.
