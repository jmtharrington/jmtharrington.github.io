		One thing I love about the information technology field is that there are so many different career options, and you can pick up new skills all the time.
		As of right now I am just trying to get my foot in the door and try to gain experience. I want to keep pursuing cybersecurity and move up through the positions.
		I also like networking so I would not mind getting a job in that side of the business. I am also interested in game design but that is more of a hobby right now,
		but it would be awesome to start a career in game design. Hopefully it won't be too much longer until I can start my working!
